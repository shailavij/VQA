## Visual Question Answering with Keras

Recent developments in Deep Learning has paved the way to accomplish tasks involving multimodal learning. Visual Question Answering (VQA) is one such challenge which requires high-level scene interpretation from images combined with language modelling of relevant Q&A. Given an image and a natural language question about the image, the task is to provide an accurate natural language answer. This is a Keras implementation of one such end-to-end system to accomplish the task.
